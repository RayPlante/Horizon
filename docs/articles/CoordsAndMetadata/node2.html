A general character of scientific data is that they represent
measurements or estimates of some physical quantity (e.g.
temperature, brightness, voltage, magnetic field, etc.).  The
measurements are made under certain quantifiable conditions, some of
which may be made to vary.  For example, one might measure temperature
over a range of pressures or brightness from different positions
within an area of the sky.  Thus, the data have a context, or in
mathematical terms, a domain which provides them with relevance.  This
context can be described as a multidimensional space in which each
axis is a quantifiable parameter describing the condition under which
each measurement was made.  If the space is well-defined (i.e. its
axes are orthogonal), then each datum can be mapped to a single
position within that space.  This domain space is often referred to as
the data's <em>world coordinate system</em>.
<P>
The Horizon Image Data Browser Java package supports a special type of
scientific data it refers to as an <em>image</em>.  In a scientific
context, an image is a set of data that regularly samples a volume of
<I>N</I>-dimensional space.<A NAME="tex2html1" HREF="footnode.html#21"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/usr/local/latex2html-96.1/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>  Data points that make up
an image are often referred to as pixels; this term, however,
connatates two dimensions, so to reflect the <I>N</I>-dimensional nature
of the data, the more general term of <em>voxel</em> will be used
instead.  Within a computer application, the data are usually
represented as an N-dimensional array in which each position in the
array maps to a position in the dataset's world coordinate space.
When visualizing this data, the scientist is usually more interested
in a datum's position within the coordinate system than its absolute
position within some data array.  So, by way of example, a useful
visualizing tool displaying a satalite image of a patch of the earth
might display the longitude and latitude of any voxel in the image
whenever it is selected with a mouse.
<P>
Implicit to displaying coordinate positions is a conversion from the
positions in the data array to positions in the coordinate system.
The function mapping the two spaces might be described by a variety of
parameters.  The parameters can be considered as <em>metadata</em> of
the coordinate system.  Horizon's support of world coordinate systems
relies heavily on its support for the notion of metadata; thus, this
document takes some time to describe Horizon's metadata model
(&#167;<A HREF="node3.html#Smetadata">2</A>) and shows how it is well suited for handling
coordinate systems.
<P>
Horizon's object model for coordinate systems tries to be flexible
enough to handle a wide variety of scientific applications.  Features
of the model include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>support for multiple <em>schemas</em>, or ways of describing a
coordinate system.  In general, the model makes no assumptions about
how a system should be parameterized or, in particular, what names
should be given to those parameters.
<LI>support for mulitple coordinate systems.  Image voxels may
logically map to positions in a variety of different coordinate
systems.  For example, positions in a satalite image might be given
either by longitude and latitude, by a relative grid position in units
of miles, or by the name of the country the position resides within.
The user can easily switch between the various systems when necessary.
<LI>two-way conversion between dataset positions and world
coordinate positions.  The mapping can be non-linear.  The conversion
might be non-reversible due to some loss of information; for instance,
converting a data position to a state name then back to a data
position might not result in the original position.
<LI>continuous data spaces.  Positions within datasets may be
fractional, allowing one to ask the coordinate position of a location
between two adjacent data voxels.
<LI>automatic display of coordinate systems in an
application-specific format.

<P>
As our definition of an image suggests, the Horizon world coordinate
system model does not explicitly support irregularly sampled data.
In most cases, one should be able to ``squeeze'' such data into
Horizon's image model and make use of Horizon tools to visualize the
data; however, given that such data lies at least in part outside of
Horizon's image model, the user may eventually encounter a limit to
the usefulness of using Horizon to visualize this type of data.
<P>
When it comes to ``ease of use'', the Horizon design tries to favor
the application programmer.  That is, when working with a fully
supported data format, one can in a few lines instantiate
full-featured objects with access to all the data necessary for
visualization and analysis; the programmer does not need to concern
him- or herself so much with how the data is read or where it is
coming from.  The programmer wishing write a reader to support a new
data format needs to understand a little more about the Horizon model;
however, a number of tools are provided to make this easier.  This
document covers both levels of detail.

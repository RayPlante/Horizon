The <TT>Metadata</TT> class shares another important feature of the
<TT>Properties</TT> class in its the support for default values; that
is, <TT>Metadata</TT> objects can store two sets of data within themselves:
primary data and default data. Calls to <TT>getMetadatum(String)</TT>
will return requested data from the primary set; if it does not exist
there, the data in the default list is searched for a value.  (One can
prevent the search of the default set by calling
<TT>getMetadatum(String, null)</TT>.)
<P>
The default data are stored as a protected <TT>Metadata</TT> <BR>[1]
field within the primary <TT>Metadata</TT> class and can only be set during
construction.  The <TT>Metadata</TT> class interface never gives out a
reference to the defaults list, preventing client objects from adding,
removing, or replacing any of its contents.  Many Horizon classes
exploit this feature as a way of keeping exclusive control of the
metadata that they manage but still allow read-only access to the
metadata.  For example, the <TT>CoordinateSystem</TT> class can share its
metadata with other objects via its <TT>getMetadata</TT> method;
however, it probably does not want to allow other objects to alter the
metadata list.  So, it has two choices: it can either clone the
<TT>Metadata</TT> list and return the new copy:
<PRE>protected Metadata mdata;
...
public Metadata getMetadata() {
    return mdata.clone();
}</PRE>
or it can use a ``protection'' technique by creating a new <TT>Metadata</TT>
list with <TT>CoordinateSystem</TT>'s own <TT>Metadata</TT> as the default:
<PRE>protected Metadata mdata;
...
public Metadata getMetadata() {
    return new Metadata(mdata);
}</PRE>
<P>
Why wouldn't the <TT>CoordinateSystem</TT> object want to return a
clone?  That depends in part on how <TT>clone</TT> is implemented.  The
deepest possible <TT>clone</TT> implementation would clone both the
primary and default hashtables plus each object in the hashtables.
This could potentially be an expensive operation if the tables contain
a lot of data, and it could be inefficient if much of the data is of a
non-updatable type (e.g. <TT>Double</TT>).  A less deep clone would
clone only the primary hashtable and the default <TT>Metadata</TT> list;
however, this also could get expensive if the default list has a
default list of its own which also has a default list and so on.  By
contrast, the ``protection'' implementation for <TT>getMetadata</TT>
does not clone any hashtables; the biggest overhead incurred is in the
creation of a single empty hashtable.
<P>
In actuality, the <TT>Metadata</TT>'s <TT>clone</TT> method only clones the
primary hastable which may or may not be an expensive operation.
Nevertheless, there are some advantages the ``protection'' technique
provides to client objects.  Suppose object <TT>aClient</TT> calls a
<TT>CoordinateSystem</TT>'s <TT>getMetadata</TT> method which returns a
<TT>Metadata</TT> object using the ``protection'' technique.  <TT>aClient</TT>
is free to update its <TT>Metadata</TT> list without affecting the copy help
the <TT>CoordinateSystem</TT>; replacement operations really only hide
the original values.  Thus, <TT>aClient</TT> can return to the default
value later, if necessary, by removing any data its added.  If, by
contrast, <TT>aClient</TT> had gotten a clone, updates would have
removed the original values of the primary hashtable.  Another feature
relates to the fact that the <TT>CoordinateSystem</TT> still has a
reference to the list being used as the defaults of <TT>aClient</TT>'s
list; in this case, we say that <TT>aClient</TT>'s <TT>Metadata</TT> object is
``attached'' to the <TT>CoordinateSystem</TT>.  The consequence of this
is that whenever <TT>aClient</TT> calls the <TT>getMetadatum</TT> method,
it is guaranteed to get the most up-to-date value for the metadatum
in use by the <TT>CoordinateSystem</TT>.
<P>
Client objects may not want their <TT>Metadata</TT> objects to have such close
connections with the <TT>Metadata</TT>'s originator.  Therefore, the <TT>Metadata</TT>
class provides a variety of methods offering different levels of
cloning and ``attachment'':
<UL><TT>
<LI> void setDefaults(Metadata)
<LI> Metadata getDefaults()
<LI> void detach()
<LI> Object clone()
<LI> Metadata detachedClone()
<LI> Metadata cloneDefaults()
<LI> Metadata deepClone()
</UL></TT>
For instance, <TT>aClient</TT> could remove the defaults list in its
<TT>Metadata</TT> object by calling <TT>setDefaults(null)</TT>.  A less severe
and usually more useful alternative would be to call <TT>detach()</TT>
which replaces the defaults list with a clone.<A NAME="tex2html6" HREF="footnode.html#671"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/usr/local/latex2html-96.1/icons/foot_motif.gif"></A>
As a result, any changes the <TT>CoordinateSystem</TT> makes to its
metadata list will not affect the list held by <TT>aClient</TT>.
<P>
Of course, protecting metadata in a defaults list does not protect
against updates to data internal to the objects contained within the
list.  Following our above example, suppose <TT>aClient</TT> gets a
<TT>double[]</TT> array from the <TT>Metadata</TT> object it got from
<TT>CoordinateSystem</TT>.  It can now change the value of one of the elements
of that array.  The next time the <TT>CoordinateSystem</TT> accesses the
array, it would see the update.  The moral here is that if you want
client objects to only have <em>complete, deep</em> read-only access to
a <TT>Metadata</TT> list, do not use updateable objects as values in that
list.  The exceptions to this rule, however, are <TT>Metavector</TT> objects
and other <TT>Metadata</TT> objects.
<P>
The <TT>Metadata</TT> class takes special care when a metadatum value is of
type <TT>Metadata</TT>.  If the <TT>getMetadatum</TT> method must resort to
getting a value from the default list and if that value is itself of
type <TT>Metadata</TT>, then it will not return a direct reference to the
sub-<TT>Metadata</TT>; instead it will set it as the default list in a new
<TT>Metadata</TT> instance which is then returned, thus protecting it from
updates by the client.
<P>
Arrays are often too useful to avoid using to hold metadata;
therefore, the Horizon package also provides the <TT>Metavector</TT> class
(described in &#167;<A HREF="node12.html#SMetavector">2.4</A>) for this purpose.  A <TT>Metavector</TT>
is much like a <TT>Metadata</TT> object, including its support for default
data; the difference is that instead of using a hashtable for storing
its data, it uses an array.  The <TT>Metadata</TT> class will also watch out
for <TT>Metavector</TT> objects extracted from the defaults list, protecting
them when necessary.
<P>
In summary, the defaults Metadata list can provide a read-only access
to metadata, limited by whether or not the stored values are of an
updateable type.  Full read-only access can be achieved if the only
updateable classes used are <TT>Metadata</TT> and <TT>Metavector</TT>.  This should be
sufficient for most cases, because the <TT>Metadata</TT> class can be
considered a kind of structure (as in C programming)--a class with
only fields but no methods.  In place of the methods, a metadata list
is governed by the schema definition for handling the data.  Of
course, a <TT>Metadata</TT> object is not as powerful as a full-featured
class; however, one of the main purposes of the <TT>Metadata</TT> class is to
provide a container for transporting this information, particularly
from persistant storage like a data file of a specific format.  Once
carried to the part of the code that will process the data, the data
can be converted into a fully intelligent class.  In fact, this is
what is done with the Horizon coordinate classes, the topic of section
&#167;<A HREF="node14.html#SWCS">3</A>.

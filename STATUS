Status of the Horizon package
=============================

Origins
-------

This library was first developed by the NCSA Radio Astronomy Imaging
Group, led by Raymond Plante, during 1996-98 as part of two
NASA-funded projects (Project Horizon, a NASA cooperative agreement
and Project 30, a NASA AISRP grant (96-OSS-10).  Version 1.3 beta-rc7 was
released in 1998.  This version was compatible with Java 1.1.

Development was discontinued after version 1.3 beta-rc7.  In 2014,
this version was uploaded to a GitHub repository
(https://github.com/RayPlante/Horizon).  Developers are welcome to
submit issues and pull requests. 

Current Status
--------------

Work is now underway to assess the overall state of the code,
including compliance with modern JVMs, compliance with current
versions of the FITS standards, and any remaining bugs.  A modern
build and test system will be added.  

There is currently no schedule for this work.

<h1>ADIL Browser</h1>

ADILViewerApplet is an applet that uses the Horizon classes to browse
images from the <a href="http://imagelib.ncsa.uiuc.edu/imagelib">NCSA
Astronomy Digital Image Library</a> (ADIL).  The applet contains two
displays, side by side.  The left side is used to display the full
image sub-sampled to fit within display region.  The right side
contains a "zoomed" sub-region of the image.  One can click the mouse
over a pixel in the left display to see a zoomed version centered on
that pixel in the right display.<p>

Below the two displays is a position display panel which tracks the
sky position corresponding to the current position of the mouse.  One
can also pop-up the image's FITS header by clicking on the adjacent
button.  <p>

The zooming factor can be changed by clicking the on one of the
buttons below the position display or by entering a percent factor in
the text field.  A factor 100% means that one data pixel is displayed
into one display pixel.  Alternatively, one can enter choose the
"Region" button; this allows one to draw a box in the left display
indicating the region to appear in right display.  <p>

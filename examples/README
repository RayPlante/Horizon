Horizon Java Image Data Browser Package
=======================================

This directory contains examples of using Horizon objects to browsing
scientific image data.  Please note that this is alpha software,
provided primarily as a preview of what the Horizon package will be
able to do when it is released in its final form.  Developers
interested in more details about building applets and applications
with Horizon objects are encouraged to peruse the source code for
these applets in addition to the API documentation included with this
package.  While you are welcome to make use of these classes now,
please note that the API is still under development and may be subject
to changes incompatible with this alpha release.

This package should have come with full copyright statements and
conditions for use, as well as, possible, API documentation.  If not,
copies may be obtained by accessing our Web site
(http://imagelib.ncsa.uiuc.edu/imagelib/Horizon/) or by sending email
to horizon@ncsa.uiuc.edu.

Running the Example Demos
=========================

To run the example demos, you should:

  * have the standard Java libraries installed on your system.  This
    could in the form of Sun's Java Developer's Kit (JDK), version 
    1.0.2 or later.  To run the demos as applets, we recommend you use
    the appletviewer that comes with JDK.

  * have the Horizon package installed on your system.  If you are
    reading this, it is probably already installed.  

  * properly set you CLASSPATH environment to include the 
    standard Java libraries, the Horizon library, and the current 
    directory.  On a Unix system in the C-shell, one might do this by 
    typing something like:

      setenv CLASSPATH <std_classpath>:<horizon_path>/classes

    where <std_classpath> is path to the standard Java libraries and 
    <horizon_path> is the directory containing the Horizon
    distribution.  (Note the dot at the end indicating the current
    directory.)  For example, on an SGI system, it may look like:

      setenv CLASSPATH /usr/java/classes:$HOME/Horizon/classes:.

    or under Bourne shell or K-shell:

      CLASSPATH=/usr/java/classes:$HOME/Horizon/classes; export CLASSPATH

    On a Windows NT/95 system, one might open an MS-DOS Prompt window
    and type:

      set CLASSPATH=C:\java\classes.zip;C:\Horizon\classes

  * change into one of individual sub-directories found in this
    directory and consult the README file there for more
    instructions.  Many of the demos require access to the example
    data that ships with this package; thus, running a demo from its
    example directory allows it to find that data automatically.  

These demos can also be run from our Web site,
http://imagelib.ncsa.uiuc.edu/imagelib/Horizon/examples.

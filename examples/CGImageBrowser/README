			   CGImageBrowser:
		   Computer Graphics Image Browser

This directory contains a demonstration of a simple browser for images
supported natively by Java (i.e. GIF and JPEG).  It can be run as
either an applet within the JDK appletviewer or as a standalone
application.  To run them, you need have JDK 1.0.2 or higher
(http://java.sun.com/products/JDK) already installed.  You also need
to properly set your CLASSPATH to include the Horizon library of
classes.  See Horizon/examples/README for details.

To run this demo as a standalone application, one usually types
something like,

   java apps.CGImageBrowser.CGImageBrowser

in this directory.  Alternatively, you could run the demo as an applet
within the appletviewer that comes with Sun's JDK.  To start as an
applet, type:

   appletviewer CGImageBrowser.html

You can also run this demo from our Web site at 
http://imagelib.ncsa.uiuc.edu/imagelib/Horizon/examples/index.html.

The applet comes up initially ready to access an GIF or JPEG image
over the Web.  You will find better performance, however, accessing
local images. To access a local image, run as a standalone application
(see above) and click on the "Browse..." button.  You should see as
files in the current directory a collection of GIF and JPEG images to
choose from.

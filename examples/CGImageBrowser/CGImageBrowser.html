A Computer Graphics Image Browser</h3>

This applet is a demonstration of a simple browser for images
supported natively by Java (i.e. GIF and JPEG).  The particular Viewer
it uses allows one to edit the location and appearance of the
graphical data selections.

<!-- datadir: the directory relative to the document base directory that
              contains the image.  Be sure to include trailing slash.
              The default is blank (i.e. the document base directory) -->
<param NAME=datadir VALUE="../data/">

<!-- imgFile: the image file name; no default.  The resulting URL
              using to obtain the image will be
              DocumentBaseDir + datadir + imgFile.                    -->
<param NAME=imgFile VALUE="io.gif">

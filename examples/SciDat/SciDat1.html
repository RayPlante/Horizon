<h3>SciDat1:<br>
A Control Panel working with a Viewer</h3>
</center>

This applet shows an example of how a control panel (in this case, a
ZoomControl Panel, on left) can cooperate with a Viewer (here, the
SciDat1Viewer, a SelectionViewer) to add functionality to an applet.
<p>

This applet comes up with an image of the Center of our Galaxy as seen
in radio waves.  <p>

<applet codebase="../../classes"
        code="apps.SciDat.SciDat1Applet.class" width=800 height=270>
<!-- datadir: the directory relative to the document base directory that
              contains the image.  Be sure to include trailing slash.
              The default is blank (i.e. the document base directory) -->
<param NAME=datadir VALUE="../data/">

<!-- imgFile: the image file name; no default.  The resulting URL
              using to obtain the image will be
              DocumentBaseDir + datadir + imgFile.                    -->
<param NAME=imgFile VALUE="GalacticCenter.gif">

The "Magnifier" button will turn on the Magnifier view to the
right.  Clicking the left mouse button in the main window selects a
data voxel which will update the magnifier view.  <p>

You can replace the main view with a zoomed version by first selecting a
data voxel in the main view.  Next selecting a zoom factor from the
choice menu in the "Zoom Over Selected Point" portion of the Zoom
Control; then press the "Zoom" button.  To zoom to an arbitrarily
shaped box, click the box selector button under the pixel position
display.  Then hold the left button down over the main view while
dragging out a box.  After selecting a box in this manner, click the
"Zoom to Box" button from the Zoom Control.  <p>

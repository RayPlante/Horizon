			   SciDat1Applet:
	  A Demonstration of the Horizon Scientific Data Browser

To run this demo as a standalone application, type:

   java apps.SciDat.SciDat1Applet

in this directory. Alternatively, you could run the demo as an applet
within the appletviewer that comes with Sun's JDK.  To start as an
applet, type

   appletviewer SciDat1.html

You can also run this demo from our Web site at 
http://imagelib.ncsa.uiuc.edu/imagelib/Horizon/examples/index.html.

This applet shows an example of how a control panel (in this case, a
ZoomControl Panel, on left) can cooperate with a Viewer (here, the
SciDat1Viewer, a SelectionViewer) to add functionality to an applet.

The "Magnifier" button will turn on the Magnifier view to the
right.  Clicking the left mouse button in the main window selects a
data voxel which will update the magnifier view. 

You can replace the main view with a zoomed version by first selecting a
data voxel in the main view.  Next selecting a zoom factor from the
choice menu in the "Zoom Over Selected Point" portion of the Zoom
Control; then press the "Zoom" button.  To zoom to an arbitrarily
shaped box, click the box selector button under the pixel position
display.  Then hold the left button down over the main view while
dragging out a box.  After selecting a box in this manner, click the
"Zoom to Box" button from the Zoom Control.

			   CoorDemoApplet:
	  A Demonstration of the Horizon Coordinate Classes

This directory contains a demonstration of a simple viewer that tracks
world coordinate positions of data voxels within a dataset.  It is
provided as an example to programmers on the use of Horizon's
coordinate classes.  For more information about these classes see
CoordsAndMetadata.html in the Horizon/docs/articles/CoordsAndMetadata
directory (you may need to download documentation separately from our
Web site: http://imagelib.ncsa.uiuc.edu/imagelib/Horizon).

To run this demo as a standalone application, type:

   java apps.CoordDemo.CoordDemoApplet

while in this directory.  Alternatively, you could run the demo as an
applet within the appletviewer that comes with Sun's JDK.  To start as
an applet, type

   appletviewer CoordDemo.html

You can also run this demo from our Web site at
http://imagelib.ncsa.uiuc.edu/imagelib/Horizon/examples/index.html.

The applet comes up initially ready to access one of a selected group
of images from the local disk for which there is coordinate system
parameters known.  One can alternatively browse other images from the
Web or on local disk.

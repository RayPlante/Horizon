This applet is a test of the Cursor and Region-of-Interest (ROI)
classes of the ncsa.horizon.awt package.  The Cursor class implements a
drag-and-drop cursor, useful for differentiating between the windowing
system cursor and an application cursor.  The ROI class implements a
graphical region of interest that can be manipulated by the user or
application.
<p>
Quick help:
Click and drag with the left (or only) mouse button to grab and
move the cursor or region.
Click and drag with the right mouse button (or equivalent) to create
and size a new rectangular region.

Use the menus and controls to change the size, attributes, and location
of the cursor.
<p>
The cursor or region can be grabbed by depressing and holding the mouse
button when the window system cursor is "inside" the object, and 
dragged by keeping the mouse button depressed while moving the mouse.
Drop the object by letting the mouse button up after grabbing/dragging
it.
<p>
Use the right mouse button (or equivalent) to define one vertex of a
rectangular (so far) region of interest.  While the mouse button is held
down, the region can be sized.  Releasing the mouse button causes the
opposite vertex of the region to be defined, completing the ROI.

The applet comes up initially ready to access a 3D images cube of
hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas from the expanding envelope of the evolved
star, IRC+10216.  The third axis in the cube represents velocity; each
slice along this access shows gas moving away from us or toward us at
a different velecity.  Pressing the "Load" button will cause the data
to be loaded and displayed.  Other FITS images can be viewed, by
either selecting another image from the applets choice menu or by
entering the URL to a valid FITS file in the text field.  (To edit the
text field, choose "Enter URL above" from the choice menu.)    <p>


A number of controls are available from the viewer's menu bar.  These
include:  <p>

<dl>
  <dt> "Data=>Slice...":     
  <dd> pops up a window for selecting 2-d slices 
       from the cube; the slice can be parallel to
       any side of the cube.  <p>

  <dt> "Data=>Range...":     
  <dd> pops up the Transfer Function panel which
       allows one to restrict the data value range 
       that gets mapped into viewable colors. <p>

  <dt> "Data=>Palletts":
  <dd> pops up a choice of five color maps that can
       be used to visualize the data <p>

  <dt> "Data=>Metadata":     
  <dd> pops up a zoom control window  <p>

  <dt> "Control=>Zoom":
  <dd> pops up a zoom control window  <p>

  <dt> "Control=>Selections":
  <dd> pops up a window for editing data selections  <p>

  <dt> "Control=>Free Position":
  <dd> this allows the positions associated with
       fractional pixels to be displayed. <p>

  <dt> "Control=>Position On Select":
  <dd> When this is turned off, the postions are   
       updated whenever the mouse moves over the   
       image.  When turned on, the positions are   
       displayed only on the last selected voxel.

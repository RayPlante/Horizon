			   CoorDemoApplet:
	  A Demonstration of the Horizon Coordinate Classes

This directory contains a demonstration of a simple viewer that tracks
world coordinate positions of data voxels within a dataset.  It is
provided as an example to programmers on the use of Horizon's
coordinate classes.  For more information about these classes see
CoordsAndMetadata.html in the Horizon/docs/articles/CoordsAndMetadata
directory.

To run this demo as a standalone application, one usually types
something like,

   java CoordDemoApplet

You can also run this demo from our Web site at 
http://imagelib.ncsa.uiuc.edu/imagelib/Horizon/examples/index.html.

The applet comes up initially ready to access one of a selected group
of images from the local disk for which there is coordinate system
parameters known.  One can alternatively browse other images from the
Web or on local disk.

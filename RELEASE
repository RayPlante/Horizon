Release Notes

New to 1.3beta
--------------

o  This package now contains a basic FITS reader.  This reader is
   limited, however, as it stores all the data from the image in
   memory.  Consequently, large or multiple images can eat up the 
   available memory pretty quickly, especially when running as an
   applet. 

o  New sub-package: ncsa.horizon.data.  This package contains classes
   for direct access and manipulation of data in a format-independent
   and type-safe way.  

o  New control panels for spreadsheet display, slice selection,
   transfer function editing, palette selection.  

o  Sub-package interdependencies:  here we note which sub-packages
   depend on each other, so that if one wants to use just one or a few
   of the classes, one can determine what other packages might also be
   needed:
   + ncsa.horizon.util:  does not depend on any of the other
       sub-packages and thus can be used independently of them in
       "non-Horizon" applications.
   + ncsa.horizon.awt:  currently does not depend on any of the other 
       sub-packages (though this could change in the future).
   + ncsa.horizon.coordinates:  depends only on ncsa.horizon.util
   + all other packages (including ncsa.horizon.awt.image) contain 
       various inter-dependencies and in general cannot be used
       without all of the Horizon sub-packages.  

o  changes to new Viewable interface:  
   +  new method: getDefaultSlice()
   +  updated methods:  getData(), getData(Volume) now returns object 
      of the NdArrayData

o  new classes for line selection:  ncsa.horizon.awt.LineSelection
   (which is analogous to Point and Rectangle).  

o  The data subset selection classes--Volume, Slice, Segment, and
   Voxel--have be overhauled to remove support for "firstAxisIndex".
   Voxel has new method: untranslate().  

o  a variety of bug fixes, enhancements, and new features.

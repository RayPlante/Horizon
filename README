Horizon Java Image Data Browser Package
=======================================

The Horizon package is a library of Java classes for browsing and
visualizing scientific image data.  It is made is made up of
Java classes and interfaces, as well as ready-to-use applets and
applications. The design is meant to (in principle) support any image
format originating either from the Web or local disk. Here are some of
the features we are working on:

     basic 2D visualization of multidimensional data 
     zooming, subsetting, animation 
     spreadsheet browsing 
     color fiddling 
     progressive image transmission 
     overlaying multiple images 
     support for collaborative sessions facilitate by the 
         NCSA Habanero Collaborative Tool 
     Easy adaptability and extensibility 

Please note that this is beta software, provided primarily as a
preview of what the Horizon package will be able to do when it is
released in its final form.  While you are welcome to make use of
these classes now, please note that the API is still under development
and may be subject to changes incompatible with this beta release.  
THIS IS THE LAST RELEASE COMPATIBLE WITH JAVA JDK 1.0.2; except for a
few possible bug fix releases, future release will be compatible with
Java 1.1.x. 

This package should have come with full copyright statements and
conditions for use, as well as, possible, API documentation.  If not,
copies may be obtained by accessing our Web site

Overview of Horizon Sub-Packages Included in This Release
=========================================================

ncsa.horizon.viewable    -- a visualization interface into a dataset
ncsa.horizon.viewer      -- viewers for displaying 2D visualizations
                            of data
ncsa.horizon.coordinates -- classes mapping voxels to world coordinates.
ncsa.horizon.awt         -- other GUI helper classes
ncsa.horizon.util        -- non GUI helper classes
ncsa.horizon.modules     -- GUI components that can drive applications
ncsa.horizon.data        -- classes associated with reading data; includes
			    format-specific readers
 
ncsa.fits                -- an adaptation of a FITS reader by Tom
			    McGlynn of NASA/GSFC.

FITSWCS                  -- library implementing the FITS proposal for
                            supporting astronomical world coordinates
Acme                     -- a few classes from Jef Poskanzer's Acme
                            package for printing floating point
                            numbers with arbitrary precision.
CoolBeans                -- a Layout Manager 
misc                     -- miscellaneous borrowed code

Running the Example Demos
=========================

To run the example demos, you should:

  * have the standard Java libraries installed on your system.  This
    could in the form of Sun's Java Developer's Kit (JDK), version 
    1.0.2 or later.  To run the demos as applets, we recommend you use
    the appletviewer that comes with JDK.

  * have the Horizon package installed on your system.  If you are
    reading this, it is probably already installed.  

  * properly set you CLASSPATH environment to include both the 
    standard Java libraries, the Horizon library, and the current 
    directory.  On a Unix system in the C-shell, one might do this by
    typing something like: 

      setenv CLASSPATH <std_classpath>:<horizon_path>/classes:.

    where <std_classpath> is path to the standard Java libraries and 
    <horizon_path> is the directory containing the Horizon
    distribution.  For example, on an SGI system, it may look like:

      setenv CLASSPATH /usr/java/classes:$HOME/Horizon/classes:.

    or under Bourne shell or K-shell:

      CLASSPATH=/usr/java/classes:$HOME/Horizon/classes:.; export CLASSPATH

See the README files in the individual sub directories here for
details about running the specific demos.  

This demos can also be run from our Web site,
http://imagelib.ncsa.uiuc.edu/imagelib/Horizon/examples.
